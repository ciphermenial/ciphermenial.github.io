> We can know only that we know nothing. And that is the highest degree of human wisdom.

*Leo Tolstoy*

My pseudonym is based on my initials. Sifr is Arabic for 0 and Moja is Swahili for 1. I chose this because I am a huge computer nerd and wanted it to be something related to computers.

I have been intrigued by computers all my life. I was lucky in that my Dad also has a love of computers and technology. This meant we had a [MicroBee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBee) in the shed when I was little, through to a 286, 486, Pentium, etc. My first personal computer was a Pentium around the time we also got dial-up Internet. I would spend a lot of my time on IRC back then, learning how to script and make eggdrops. From then on I have always been tinkering with computers.

In the late 90s I started playing with Linux, with my first attempts installing [Caldera OpenLinux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera_OpenLinux) and [Redhat](https://www.redhat.com). I tried many different Linux distributions and then settled on Gentoo. I had a fairly low powered PC that struggled with playing .avi files at the time but compiling Gentoo to work specifically with the hardware on that machine allowed them to run smoothly. Eventually I got tired of spending far too long reinstalling Gentoo when I broke things and switched to the new fancy Ubuntu. I used Ubuntu for a long time until recently switching over to using Debian for almost everything.
